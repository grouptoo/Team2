<h4> BADGES </h4>
	
 What are Digital Badges? </br>
A Digital Badge is a cross-industry digital recognition of technical</br> skills which can be shared on your social and professional networking sites, </br>
as well as your digital signature.


IBM is supporting this new program, based on open standards, through the creation</br> of a wide variety of badges covering a multitude of 
technical and professional areas.
	
	
	
	<h4>EXPLORER AWARD</h4>
The Explorer Award badge represents <br> achievements on the part of the learner who 
is in the earlier stages <br>of acquiring knowledge and developing skills for<br>
 a particular area of interest. Activities<br> associated with Explorer badges
 include instructor led training, <br>self-directed learning 
 assignments, workshops, mentoring<br> sessions, and quizzes or assessments.<br>

	<h4>MASTERY AWARD </h4>
The Mastery Award badge is awarded to individuals who have successfully completed <br>and passed the IBM Skills Academy
 final exam. This badge is
 typically associated with the <br>learner who has achieved and demonstrated a high level of understanding of the topic<br>
